This directory contains files and scripts used for creating and deploying PDF-based payloads during the forensic case study simulation. These payloads are designed to mimic real-world attack vectors, particularly those that exploit PDF documents to deliver malicious content or initiate system-level actions.

Contents:
create_malicious_pdf.py – Python script to generate a PDF file embedded with a payload.

deploy_pdf_payload.bat – Batch script to simulate the execution of the malicious PDF.

Security_Update_2025.pdf – A sample malicious PDF used as bait in the simulated phishing attack.

⚠️ Disclaimer: All files in this directory are for educational and forensic simulation purposes only. Do not execute or distribute outside of a controlled lab environment.
